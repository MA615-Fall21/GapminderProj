# GapminderProj
Gapminder has a wealth of country-level statistics.  This assignment is about exploring that data, and then presenting what you have noticed.  Additionally, we are going to ask you to explain how you went about the coding of your presentation. 

# Literacy rates and poverty rates across the world

**Literacy Rates:**  the percent of people ages 15 and above who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life  
**Extreme Poverty Rates:** the percent of people who have less than $5.50 per day

1. Countries are becoming more literate
2. There seems to be a minimum threshold of literacy to allow for a lower poverty rate
3. High literacy does not guarantee low poverty
